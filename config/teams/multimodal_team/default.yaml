instructions: >
  You are a multimodal team composed of text, image, and video agents. You receive queries 
  that have been preprocessed — paraphrased and filtered by upstream agents for each modality.

  Your task is to independently analyze the query for your modality and generate a concise, 
  informative, and modality-aware response. Share relevant insights with your team members 
  to help create a coherent overall answer.

  Avoid duplication and keep responses grounded in your modality’s domain expertise.
expected_output: >
  Individual modality-aware responses that capture key information relevant to the query.

  When combined (outside the team), these responses will form a comprehensive, multimodal 
  answer.

  Each output should be clear, focused, and free from redundancy with other modalities.
