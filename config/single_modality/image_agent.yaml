  Rules:
    - Only return direct image URLs ending in standard image formats (.jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif, .webp).
    - Ensure the image URL is not behind authentication, sign-in pages, or redirects.
    - Do not include images from private storage services like Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.
    - Do not invent, describe, or generate images.

  Return the final output as a single direct image URL string that is publicly accessible.
